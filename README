WebService-Google-Closure

WebService::Google::Closure is an object-oriented interface to the
Google Closure Javascript compiler API (http://code.google.com/closure/).

The Google Closure Compiler compiles JavaScript into compact,
high-performance code. The compiler removes dead code and rewrites and
minimizes what's left so that it downloads and runs quickly. It also also
checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common
JavaScript pitfalls. These checks and optimizations help you write apps
that are less buggy and easier to maintain

This module provides a Moose-powered Perl interface to the Google
Javascript compiler service.

It also provides a command line tool to easily compile your javascript
files;

 # Compiles file1.js and file2.js into comlied.js using advanced optimizations
 cat js/file1.js js/file2.js | closure-compile -l 3 > compiled.js
